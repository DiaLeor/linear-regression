# On Base Plus Slugging (OPS) ---------------------------------------------

# The on-base-percentage plus slugging percentage (OPS) metric is:
# BA/PA + (Singles + 2Doubles + 3Triples + 4HR)/AB

# Regression Fallacy ------------------------------------------------------

# Regression can bring about errors in reasoning, especially when interpreting individual
# observations.

# The example showed in the video demonstrates that the "sophomore slump" observed in the
# data is caused by regressing to the mean.

#..Code..
# The code to create a table with player ID, their names, and their most played position:
library(Lahman)
playerInfo <- Fielding %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>%
  arrange(desc(G)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  left_join(People, by="playerID") %>%
  select(playerID, nameFirst, nameLast, POS)

# The code to create a table with only the ROY award winners and add their batting statistics:
ROY <- AwardsPlayers %>%
  filter(awardID == "Rookie of the Year") %>%
  left_join(playerInfo, by="playerID") %>%
  rename(rookie_year = yearID) %>%
  right_join(Batting, by="playerID") %>%
  mutate(AVG = H/AB) %>%
  filter(POS != "P")

# The code to keep only the rookie and sophomore seasons and remove players who did not play
# sophomore seasons:
ROY <- ROY %>%
  filter(yearID == rookie_year | yearID == rookie_year+1) %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>%
  mutate(rookie = ifelse(yearID == min(yearID), "rookie", "sophomore")) %>%
  filter(n() == 2) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  select(playerID, rookie_year, rookie, nameFirst, nameLast, AVG)

# The code to use the spread function to have one column for the rookie and sophomore years
# batting averages:
ROY <- ROY %>% spread(rookie, AVG) %>% arrange(desc(rookie))
ROY

# The code to calculate the proportion of players who have a lower batting average their
# sophomore year:
mean(ROY$sophomore - ROY$rookie <= 0)

# The code to do the similar analysis on all players that played the 2013 and 2014 seasons and
# batted more than 130 times (minimum to win Rookie of the Year):
two_years <- Batting %>%
  filter(yearID %in% 2013:2014) %>%
  group_by(playerID, yearID) %>%
  filter(sum(AB) >= 130) %>%
  summarize(AVG = sum(H)/sum(AB)) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  spread(yearID, AVG) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`2013`) & !is.na(`2014`)) %>%
  left_join(playerInfo, by="playerID") %>%
  filter(POS!="P") %>%
  select(-POS) %>%
  arrange(desc(`2013`)) %>%
  select(nameFirst, nameLast, `2013`, `2014`)
two_years

# The code to see what happens to the worst performers of 2013:
arrange(two_years, `2013`)

# The code to see  the correlation for performance in two separate years:
qplot(`2013`, `2014`, data = two_years)

summarize(two_years, cor(`2013`,`2014`))

# Measurement Error Models ------------------------------------------------

# Up to now, all our linear regression examples have been applied to two or more random variables.
# We assume the pairs are bivariate normal and use this to motivate a linear model.

# Another use for linear regression is with measurement error models, where it is common to have a
# non-random covariate (such as time). Randomness is introduced from measurement error rather than
# sampling or natural variability.

#..Code..
# The code to use dslabs function rfalling_object to generate simulations of dropping balls:
library(dslabs)
falling_object <- rfalling_object()

# The code to draw the trajectory of the ball:
falling_object %>%
  ggplot(aes(time, observed_distance)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Distance in meters") +
  xlab("Time in seconds")

# The code to use the lm() function to estimate the coefficients:
fit <- falling_object %>%
  mutate(time_sq = time^2) %>%
  lm(observed_distance~time+time_sq, data=.)

tidy(fit)

# The code to check if the estimated parabola fits the data:
augment(fit) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(time, observed_distance)) +
  geom_line(aes(time, .fitted), col = "blue")

# The code to see the summary statistic of the regression:
tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE)
